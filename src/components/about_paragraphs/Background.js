        Having worked in the exciting live music environment, I developed a
        thorough understanding of managing tight deadlines, efficient
        problem-solving skills and understanding of technical tools and systems
        as well as a budget conscious approach to product creation. I gained a
        deep understanding of how to manage a team in a high stress environment
        for an extended period of time.

        debate to generate new ideas.
